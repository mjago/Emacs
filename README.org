* Emacs Configuration

** How it works

  - Configuration is "On top of" the [[https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit][emacs-starter-kit]] configs
  - Emacs Starter Kit loads my martyn.el file which in turn loads
    [[https://github.com/mjago/Emacs/blob/master/init.org][init.org]]

** The martyn.el file within ~/.emacs.d

 - NOTE! All config goes in [[https://github.com/mjago/Emacs/blob/master/init.org][init.org]] - no config goes in here!
 - This file is loaded by  [[https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/blob/master/init.el][init.el]], which is the standard emacs starter kit [[https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/blob/master/init.el][init.el]]
 - This file ensures my auto-generated init.el file does not yet
   exist! This may have occurred if there was a load failure previously.
 - This file then loads and runs  [[https://github.com/mjago/Emacs/blob/master/init.org][init.org]] using babel to make my personal configurations.
 - My personal init.el file is then created via babel tangle - Emacs
   initialised - and is finally deleted.
