* Emacs Configuration

** How it works

  - Configuration is "On top of" the [[https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit][*emacs-starter-kit*]] configs
  - Emacs Starter Kit loads my *martyn.el* file which in turn loads
    *Emacs/init.org* using *Emacs org-babel*.
  - This setup allows for easy update of *emacs-starter-kit*, and
    revision control of personal settings, and enables having a
    'literate' configuration. A great example of this is
    [[https://github.com/eschulte/emacs-starter-kit][eschulte's literate emacs-starter-kit]]

** The martyn.el file within ~/.emacs.d

 - NOTE! All config goes in *~/.emacs.d/martyn/init.org* - /no config goes in here!/
 - This file is loaded by  [[https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/blob/master/init.el][init.el]], which is the standard /emacs starter kit/ [[https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/blob/master/init.el][init.el]].
 - This file ensures my auto-generated *init.el* file does not yet
   exist! This may have occurred if there was a load failure previously.
 - This file then loads and runs *init.org* using babel to make my personal configurations.
 - My *personal init.el* file is then created via *org-babel* - Emacs
   initialised - and finally deleted.
